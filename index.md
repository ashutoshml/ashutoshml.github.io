        Given a sentence (e.g., "I like mangoes") and a constraint (e.g., sentiment flip), the goal of controlled text generation is to produce a sentence that adapts the input sentence to meet the requirements of the constraint (e.g., "I hate mangoes"). Going beyond such simple constraints, recent works have started exploring the incorporation of complex syntactic-guidance as constraints in the task of controlled paraphrase generation. In these methods, syntactic-guidance is sourced from a separate exemplar sentence. However, these prior works have only utilized limited syntactic information available in the parse tree of the exemplar sentence. We address this limitation in the paper and propose Syntax Guided Controlled Paraphraser (SGCP), an end-to-end framework for syntactic paraphrase generation. We find that SGCP can generate syntax conforming sentences while not compromising on relevance. We perform extensive automated and human evaluations over multiple real-world English language datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of SGCP over state-of-the-art baselines. To drive future research, we have made SGCPâ€™s source code available.

        Inducing diversity in the task of paraphrasing is an important problem in NLP with applications in data augmentation and conversational agents. Previous paraphrasing approaches have mainly focused on the issue of generating semantically similar paraphrases, while paying little attention towards diversity.  In fact, most of the methods rely solely on top-k beam search sequences to obtain a set of paraphrases. The resulting set, however, contains many structurally similar sentences. In this work, we focus on the task of obtaining highly diverse paraphrases while not compromising on paraphrasing quality. We provide a novel formulation of the problem in terms of monotone submodular function maximization, specifically targeted towards the task of paraphrasing. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for data augmentation on multiple tasks such as intent classification and paraphrase recognition. In order to drive further research, we have made the source code available

        E-commerce companies such as Amazon, Alibaba and Flipkart process billions of orders every year. However, these orders represent only a small fraction of all plausible orders. Exploring the space of all plausible orders could help us better understand the relationships between the various entities in an e-commerce ecosystem, namely the customers and the products they purchase. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for orders made in e-commerce websites. Once trained, the generator in the GAN could generate any number of plausible orders. Our contributions include: (a) creating a dense and low-dimensional representation of e-commerce orders, (b) train an ecommerceGAN (ecGAN) with real orders to show the feasibility of the proposed paradigm, and (c) train an ecommerce-conditional-GAN (ec2GAN) to generate the plausible orders involving a particular product. We propose several qualitative methods to evaluate ecGAN and demonstrate its effectiveness. The ec2GAN is used for various kinds of characterization of possible orders involving a product that has just been introduced into the e-commerce system. The proposed approach ec2GAN performs significantly better than the baseline in most of the scenarios.

        Data augmentation is an important component in the robustness evaluation of models in natural language processing (NLP) and in enhancing the diversity of the data they are trained on. In this paper, we present NL-Augmenter, a new participatory Python-based natural language augmentation framework which supports the creation of both transformations (modifications to the data) and filters (data splits according to specific features). We describe the framework and an initial set of 117 transformations and 23 filters for a variety of natural language tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of NL-Augmenter by using several of its transformations to analyze the robustness of popular natural language models. The infrastructure, datacards and robustness analysis results are available publicly on the NL-Augmenter repository.
